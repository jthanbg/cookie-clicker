A Cookie Clicker style game (called "Concrete Click").
I forgot to make a folder specifically for the sound effects :/
The game includes an object to click, as well as a coin system that allows you to purchase a button which increases your coin count.
The price of this button increases every time the button is bought by a certain factor.
Every 100 clicks, a specific sound plays.
