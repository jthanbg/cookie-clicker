A Cookie Clicker style game (called "Concrete Click"). The game includes an object to click, as well as a coin system that allows you to purchase a button which increases your coin count. The price of this button increases every time the button is bought by a certain factor (that can be modified within the code). Every 100 clicks, a specific sound plays.
